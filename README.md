## 📝 Sample Practice Questions

✔ **Basic SELECT Queries** → List all customers, find films longer than 100 mins, display rentals on a given date

✔ **Filtering** → Customers from London, films with rental rate between 2–5, NULL checks

✔ **Sorting & Limiting** → Top 10 expensive films, earliest rentals, most recent payments

✔ **Joins** → Films with categories, customers with city names, rentals with staff names

✔ **Aggregations** → Count films, calculate average payments, revenue per store

✔ **Subqueries** → Most rented film, top customers, films longer than average

✔ **Complex Joins** → Top 5 customers by rentals, total revenue per country, least rented film

📌 More than **150+ solved examples** included using **dvdrental** database.
